# Model Management Database Restore
----------------------------------

This chapter presents information regarding restoring the two Model Management Database solutions: `pgsql` (for standalone database deployments) and `patroni` (for HA database deployments).

The processes described in this chapter only need to be executed if the Model Managmement premium feature has been purchased and configured as part of the DataRobot installation.
