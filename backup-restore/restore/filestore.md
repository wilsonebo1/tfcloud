# Filestore Restore
-------------------

This chapter presents information regarding restoring the two, bundled DataRobot filestore solutions: `gluster` and `minio`. Other filestore solutions (such as Hadoop, AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage) are beyond the scope of this document and a custom backup strategy should be created and tested by your application administration team in collaboration with the DataRobot Customer Success team.

It is recommended that the filestore be restored first as it contains data that is linked to by the rest of the DataRobot Platform.
