# DataRobot Administration Guide

This guide is intended to help administrators manage their DataRobot On-Premise AI Cluster, Private AI Cloud, and Hybrid AI Cloud deployments. As a DataRobot Admin, you will create and manage user accounts, monitor user activity and resource use, and troubleshoot user issues. Contact DataRobot Customer Support if you need help beyond what is explained in this guide.
